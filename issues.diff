Possible Stars from a 0 Star File: 116/130
Possible Stars from a pre-made 120 File: 129 
(techinically 128 since you can't access Metal Cap)

---Bob-omb Island---
(FIXED) Star 6 - Smash the Chain Chomp's Rocks (No secrets)

---Chuckya Harbor---
(FIXED) Star 4 - Break into the Building (Windows dont break)

---Creepy Cap Cave--- 
(FIXED) Not Possible to enter, leaving both stars and the cap switch unobtainable

---Retro Remix Castle---
(FIXED) B2 Key doesn't spawn in the correct spot, instead it spawns inside a stalagmite, making it unobtainable, and all of upstairs and "Star Road" impossible to reach

(FIXED) Alot of textures are pretty wonky, you probably knew already though
 (Vanish Cap, Wing Cap, Starlight Runway, Large Leaf Forest, Koopa Canyon, Colorful Coral Caverns)

(FIXED) All Chain Chomps still have their poles (Bob-omb Islands, Koopa Canyon, Cloudrail Station)

(FIXED) The Flying Thwomps in Cloudrail Station aren't solid making Wing Cap not possible to reach through the intended path, and the two  thwomps next to them are usually very large; this made Star 5, The Giant Thwomp's Treasure, impossible through the intended method

(FIXED) Many platforms are not in the correct spot. (Gloomy Garden (Star 6- Calm the Angry Eye), Cloudrail Station, Bob-omb Battle Factory

The Grand Star at the end of B3 puts the players in the end cutscene,
instead of warping you to the night time version of Castle Grounds. This
makes a star impossible to grab, as there is one in that area.

(FIXED) Yoshi is a bit weird. When Spawning into the game, he teleports to the lake on the left side of Star Leap Tower

(FIXED) The star requirements are untouched as I've seen.

---Correct Star Requirements---
(FIXED) Mips: 15 Stars ---> 0 Stars

(FIXED) Toad 1 (Cannonshot to a little cubby outside Star Leap): 12 Stars ---> 0 Stars

(FIXED) Star Leap Tower Cannon: 120 Stars ---> 65 Stars

(FIXED) Due to Metal Cap being unreachable, Toad 2 is only possible to reach through a BLJ.
