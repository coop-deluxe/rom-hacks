Fine, I'll stop eating\n\

you take this shiny\n\

some bad news.\n\
Bowser learned the secret\n\
to reaching the world\n\
of the Star Spirits, and\n\
he's set up a base there.\n\
The big problem is that\n\
he now has access to\n\
a whole heap of\n\
Star Road portals which\n\
lead all over the\n\
Mushroom Kingdom!\n\
He's been using them to\n\
transport swarms of his\n\
troops, and they're\n\
causing chaos\n\
all over the place!\n\
Mario, if you are\n\
going to stop Bowser,\n\
you will need to use\n\
the Star Road at the\n\
top of Star-Leap Tower\n\
to find him. Bowser has \n\
sealed all the doors \n\
leading up the tower, but \n\
you should be able to\n\
break through if you can\n\
collect enough power\n\
stars to break the seals.\n\
Good luck!")

One of Bowser's wacky\n\
